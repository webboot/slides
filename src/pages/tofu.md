trust on first use.

this is a central problem of the web that has not been solved.

we can not trust any page we load in a browser,
anything can be changed at any time.

a cryptographically encrypted, verified, signed, salted, peppered,
decentralized,
uncensored,
offline first,
and peer 2 peer connected,
application mesh network
world of the future
