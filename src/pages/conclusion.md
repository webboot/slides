# conclusion

we have a serious trust problem, and now that you know,
you might have joined those of us that wake up deep at night,
in cold sweat, and think about becoming a gardener.

now is the time to become a gardener. plant food.

do not trust the web, do your due diligence,
especially when dealing with your finances
or data you would not want everybody to see.

it is not your wallet if you do not have the private key.

until webboot arrives, install noscript. it just breaks the internet, no biggie.
