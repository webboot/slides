hello everyone, and welcome from the parallele polis headquarters in vienna.

i am sitting here with @exiledsurfer and we are busy working
remotely together with kay, who is a hero btw!,
and a number of other awesome volunteers and streamers,
on keeping the various parts running that make this conference possible.

it has been a pretty wild ride for our team the last few weeks,
but we made it so far, i am talking here now,
which means the server is keeping up and the streams are working.
this is incredible.

let me start with the obligatory prayer

i pray to the demo gods,
please do not punish me for my recklessness.
please let there be no unexpected errors.

i also want to mention that this virus is not the only reason why i wear mask and glasses.

i might cough from time to time.
i had this exact same cough since november,
but i take this very serious since february.

i might and i think i should, talk about this at the end,
but lets see how much time there is.

lets get on topic

`stream switch to my laptop`

webboot allows us to verify the content of homepages, before we load them.






i started working on this project in january,
i have some parts done, but there still is a lot of work to do.

i have been in quarantine for 4 weeks now and before that i had about 5 direct contacts in my personal life,
the only group gatherings i went to were the weekly meetups of our ngo and nobody got sick here before.

i might have finally become sick myself 3 weeks ago, but if i am spreading,
i am spreading this since november.

i now have almost no symptoms except the cough for about 2 weeks,
and being here with michael will be my only contact for the next 3 days.

lets see where i quarantine next, i have access to a garden nearby
and i think planting food might be a good plan.

all three of us were denied tests.

we do not get closer than 3 meters to her after she opened the door,
but unfortunately
