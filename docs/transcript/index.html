remotely together with kay, who is a hero btw!,
and a number of other awesome volunteers and streamers,
on keeping the various parts running that make this conference possible.</p><p>it has been a pretty wild ride for our team the last few weeks,
but we made it so far, i am talking here now,
which means the server is keeping up and the streams are working.
this is incredible.</p><p>let me start with the obligatory prayer</p><p>i pray to the demo gods,
please do not punish me for my recklessness.
please let there be no unexpected errors.</p><p>i also want to mention that this virus is not the only reason why i wear mask and glasses.</p><p>i might cough from time to time.
i had this exact same cough since november,
but i take this very serious since february.</p><p>i might and i think i should, talk about this at the end,
but lets see how much time there is.</p><p>lets get on topic</p><div class="Pre"><div class="menu"><button>copy</button></div><pre><code class="line">stream <span class="keyword">switch</span> to my laptop</code></pre></div><p>abstract</p><p>webboot allows us to verify the content of homepages, before we load them.</p><p>i started working on this project in january,

the only group gatherings i went to were the weekly meetups of our ngo and nobody got sick here before.</p><p>i might have finally become sick myself 3 weeks ago, but if i am spreading,
i am spreading this since november.</p><p>i now have almost no symptoms except the cough for about 2 weeks,
and being here with michael will be my only contact for the next 3 days.</p><p>lets see where i quarantine next, i have access to a garden nearby
and i think planting food might be a good plan.</p><p>all three of us were denied tests.</p><p>we do not get closer than 3 meters to her after she opened the door,
but unfortunately</p></div><footer class="Footer"><div class="Container"><div class="Credits">made with a few bits of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://magic.github.io/">magic</a></div></div></footer></div></main><script src="/magic.js?aaQjzBu0HI" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
